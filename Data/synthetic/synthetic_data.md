The [jointseg](https://github.com/rforge/jointseg) R package  was used to generate three Affymetrix SNP 6.0 array-like synthetic tumour data sets, each consisting of 400 samples and 1.844.000 probes, respectively. 
We generated 100 samples with 30%, 50%, 70% and 100% tumour purity, respectively. For each sample we set the number of breakpoints(loci where the copy number changes) to three. For the four resulting regions we samples the copy number states from a pre-defined set of copy number labels: (0,1), (0,2), (1,1), (1,2).
