The [jointseg](https://github.com/rforge/jointseg) R package  was used to generate three Affymetrix SNP 6.0 array-like synthetic tumour data sets, each consisting of 400 samples and 1.844.000 probes, respectively. <br/>
We generated 100 samples with 30%, 50%, 70% and 100% tumour purity, respectively. For each sample we set the number of breakpoints (loci where the copy number changes) to 3. <br/>
For the 4 resulting regions, we sample the copy number states from a pre-defined set of copy number labels: (0,1), (0,2), (1,1), (1,2).
